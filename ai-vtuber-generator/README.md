# AI VTuber Generator (placeholder)

Minimal Node.js Express placeholder app for deploying an AI VTuber generator. This repo contains a small web server with a `/generate` endpoint that should be replaced with actual calls to the Gemini API using the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable.

How to run locally:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start: `npm start`

Deploy to Railway/Render/Heroku: see `github-commands.txt`.
